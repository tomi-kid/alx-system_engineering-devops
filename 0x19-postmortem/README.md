## Debugging Process Postmortem: Apache Server Issue

# Issue Summary:
Duration: July 15, 2023, 08:00 AM (UTC) to July 15, 2023, 09:30 AM (UTC)
Duration: Approximately 1 hour
Impact: The Apache web server was serving a 500 Internal Server Error due to a file path error in the wp-settings.py file.

# Root Cause:
The root cause of the issue was a typo in the file path specified in the wp-settings.py file, leading to a 500 Internal Server Error.

# Timeline:

(Time not provided, assuming around 19:20 PST): The issue was discovered when instructed to address it, and debugging promptly began.
Checked Running Processes: Verified two apache2 processes - root and www-data - were properly running using ps aux.
Identified Web Server Location: Confirmed the web server was serving content located in /var/www/html/ by inspecting the sites-available folder in the /etc/apache2/ directory.
Strace on root Apache Process: Ran strace on the PID of the root Apache process in one terminal.
Curl Testing: Ran curl on the server in another terminal, but strace did not provide useful information.
Strace on www-data Process: Repeated step 3, this time on the PID of the www-data process, and found an -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) error when attempting to access /var/www/html/wp-includes/class-wp-locale.pyy.
File Inspection: Reviewed files in the /var/www/html/ directory one-by-one, located the erroneous .pyp file extension in the wp-settings.py file (Line 137, require_once( ABSPATH . WPINC . '/class-wp-locale.py' );).
Correction: Removed the trailing "p" from the line in the wp-settings.py file.
Verification: Tested another curl on the server, receiving a 200 OK response.
Automation: Created a Puppet manifest to automate the fix for the error.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was a typo in the wp-settings.py file, where the file path specified included an erroneous ".pyy" extension, leading to a 500 Internal Server Error. The issue was resolved by manually correcting the file path in the wp-settings.py file.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Automated Configuration: Use configuration management tools like Puppet to automate server setup and configuration to minimize manual errors.
Thorough Testing: Implement comprehensive testing after changes to catch errors and regressions early in the development process.
File Path Consistency: Maintain consistent file path conventions to prevent issues caused by typos or incorrect paths.
Monitoring and Alerts: Set up monitoring and alerting systems to quickly detect and respond to server errors.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Update the wp-settings.py file in the /var/www/html/ directory to correct the file path with the appropriate extension.
Document the root cause, the resolution steps, and the Puppet manifest created for future reference.
Review and improve the testing process to catch such issues during development.
Implement automated testing for server configuration to prevent similar issues in the future.
By implementing these tasks and measures, we aim to prevent similar file path-related errors and ensure a more robust and reliable Apache web server.
